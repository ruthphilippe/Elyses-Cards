# Elyses-Cards

As a magician-to-be, Elyse needs to practice some basics. She has a stack of cards that she wants to manipulate.

To make things a bit easier she only uses the cards 1 to 10 so her stack of cards can be represented by an array of numbers. The position of a certain card corresponds to the index in the array. That means position 0 refers to the first card, position 1 to the second card etc. In this exercise, I was able to help her retrieve the different cards using JavaScript. 

Task #1 To pick a card, return the card at index position from the given stack.

Task #2 Perform some sleight of hand and exchange the card at index position with the replacement card provided. Return the adjusted stack.

Task #3 Make a card appear by inserting a new card at the top of the stack. Return the adjusted stack.

Task #4 Make a card disappear by removing the card at the given position from the stack. Return the adjusted stack.

Task #5 Make a card disappear by removing the card at the top of the stack. Return the adjusted stack.

Task #6 Make a card appear by inserting a new card at the bottom of the stack. Return the adjusted stack.

Task #7 Make a card disappear by removing the card at the bottom of the stack. Return the adjusted stack.

Task #8 Check whether the size of the stack is equal to stackSize or not.
